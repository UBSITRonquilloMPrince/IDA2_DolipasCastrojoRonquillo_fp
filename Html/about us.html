        <h1>Key Aspects of SDG 11's Mission:</h1>
        <p><li>Inclusivity: Ensuring that all residents, regardless of background or circumstance, have equal access to opportunities and resources. This includes addressing issues like poverty, inequality, and discrimination within urban areas.</li></p>
        <p><li>Safety: Creating secure environments free from violence, crime, and hazards. This involves improving infrastructure, promoting public safety initiatives, and addressing underlying social issues that contribute to insecurity.</li></p>
        <p><li>Resilience: Building the capacity of cities to withstand and recover from shocks and stresses, such as natural disasters, economic downturns, and climate change impacts. This requires robust infrastructure, effective disaster preparedness, and adaptive planning.</li></p>
        <p><li>Sustainability: Promoting environmentally responsible urban development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. This involves reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving resource management, and protecting natural ecosystems within and around urban areas.</li></p>
        <h4>Several significant obstacles hinder progress toward SDG 11:</h4>
        <p><li>Rapid Urbanization: The sheer speed of urbanization in many developing nations strains infrastructure and resources. This leads to overcrowded slums, inadequate housing, and insufficient access to essential services like clean water and sanitation</li></p>
        <p><li>Climate Change: Cities are disproportionately vulnerable to climate change impacts like extreme weather events, sea-level rise, and heat waves. These events can cause significant damage to infrastructure and displace populations, particularly in low-income areas.</li></p>
        <p><li>Inequality: Urban areas often exhibit stark inequalities, with disparities in access to housing, healthcare, education, and employment opportunities. This disproportionately affects marginalized groups, exacerbating social and economic divides.</li></p>
        <p><li>Lack of Resources: Achieving SDG 11 requires substantial financial and technical resources, which many developing countries lack. International cooperation and investment are crucial to bridge this gap.</li></p>
